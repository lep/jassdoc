/**
Creates a sound handle.

@note You can only play the same sound handle once.

@note You can only play the same sound filepath four times.

@note Sounds of the same filepath (on different sound handles) must have a delay
of at least 0.1 seconds inbetween them to be played.
You can overcome this by starting one earlier and then using `SetSoundPosition`.

@note You can only play 16 sounds in general.

@param fileName The path to the file.

@param looping Looping sounds will restart once the sound duration has finished.

@param is3D 3D Sounds can be played on particular areas of the map. They are at
their loudest when the camera is close to the sound's coordinates.

@param fadeInRate How quickly the sound fades in. The higher the number, the
faster the sound fades in. Maximum number is 127.

@param fadeOutRate How quickly the sound fades out. The higher the number, the
faster the sound fades out. Maximum number is 127.

@param eaxSetting EAX is an acronym for environmental audio extensions. In the
sound editor, this corresponds to the "Effect" setting.
The known settings available in Warcraft III are:

| Value              |  Setting               |
|--------------------| ---------------------- |
|`"CombatSoundsEAX"` | combat                 |
|`"KotoDrumsEAX"`    | drums                  | 
|`"SpellsEAX"`       | spells                 |
|`"MissilesEAX"`     | missiles               |
|`"HeroAcksEAX"`     | hero acknowledgements  |
|`"DoodadsEAX"`      | doodads                |
|`"DefaultEAXON"`    | default                |
