/**
Creates a weather effect that is spatially limited to the specified area.

This creates a new object and returns its handle, to prevent leaks it must be destroyed
with `RemoveWeatherEffect` when no longer needed.

The weather effect is created initially disabled and must be turned on with `EnableWeatherEffect`.

**Example (Lua):** to create an "Ashenvale Heavy Rain" at map center:

```{.lua}
center = Rect(-1024, -1024, 1024, 1024)
weather = AddWeatherEffect(center, FourCC("RAhr"))
EnableWeatherEffect(weather, true)
```

@param where The rect where the weather will be visible.

@param effectID (Rawcode) Which weather preset to apply.

@note To understand more about weather effects nature, I advise to read
Ammorth's article about weather effects: <http://www.wc3c.net/showthread.php?t=91176>.

@note To get an idea on how to add your own weather effects, you may read
CryoniC's article about custom weather effects: <http://www.wc3c.net/showthread.php?t=67949>.

@note The weather effects are defined in `terrainart/weather.slk` in game files.
The [current default list is here](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/how-to-create-random-weather.198658/post-1953519) (v1.32.10).

/**
Create a crater at the given coordinates.

@note To approximate the resulting height of a point `distance` units away from the
center point `(x, y)` you can use the following formula: `Cos(bj_PI/2 * distance / radius) * -depth`. See this [issue](https://github.com/lep/jassdoc/issues/31) for some more information.

@note Not every player might display those transformations due to graphics
settings. Thus reading data like terrain height might lead to async values.
See the other note on a way to compute an appropiate height to use instead.

@param x The x coordinate of the craters center.

/**
Attaches the special effect to the attachment point attachPointName of the

Upon creation, the effect will play its "birth" animation followed by its "stand" animation (once the birth animation has finished). If the model does not have animations, it will show up the way it appears by default. The effect will last indefinitely unless it is destroyed, even if the model seems to disappear. To destroy an effect, see DestroyEffect.


@param modelName The path of the model. Use double backslashes when specifying
a directory, rather than single backslashes. See AddSpecialEffect for an example.

@param targetWidget The widget to attach the effect to.

@param  attachPointName The attachment point of the widget where the effect will
be placed. Attachment points are points in a model that can be referenced to as
areas for effects to be attached, whether it be from a spell or this function.
A list of common attachment points in in-game Warcraft 3 models can be seen below.
If the attachment point does not exist, it will attach the effect to the model's origin.

@note Strings such as "Large" and "Medium" affect effects' sizes on the widget
it is attached to. You can add or remove these by going to the object editor and
modifying "Art - Required Animation Names - Attachments" for a particular unit
you are attaching effects to. 

@note To create an effect only visible to one player see <https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/gs.300430/#post-3209073>.
