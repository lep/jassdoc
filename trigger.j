Tries to find a function with the given name and calls it in a new thread.

called in another type of context, it will spawn a new trigger, which can be seen with GetTriggeringTrigger.

Adds an action to be called when the given trigger is fired through registered events or through TriggerExecute.

@note More than one action can be added to the trigger. The actions run in the order they were added.

@note The same function can be used more than once on the same trigger.

@note Actions wait for their forerunner to finish. So if there are TriggerSleepActions, subsequent actions will be delayed accordingly.

@note If an action execution crashes, subsequent actions will be unaffected and still be called.

@bug If an action execution crashes after a TriggerSleepAction in the same action execution, subsequent actions will not be run.

@note New actions added to the trigger during the execution of the actions won't be subject for execution for this run.

/**
Makes a trigger execution sleep for a given duration. The thread will yield so other threads can do their work.

@note This works only in a trigger action execution context, not in trigger conditions nor for example in timer functions or ForGroup functions. However, it
also works in ExecuteFunc contexts, even if the ExecuteFunc call is not in a trigger action execution context.

@note This has many implications, see other trigger-related natives.

@note This ticks while the game was paused with the GamePause native, unlike timers.

@note This does not tick while the game was paused by the user, neither in singleplayer nor in multiplayer. (But the Trigger Editor of the World Editor
denotes it as a real-time wait. Is this a bug?)

/**
Evaluates all functions that were added to the trigger via `TriggerAddCondition`.

Returns the boolean value of the return value from the condition-function.
So if the condition-functions return `0`/`0.0`/`null`, then `TriggerEvaluate`
will return `false`. Note that an empty string `""` would return `true`.

@note If a condition-function crashes the thread or does not return any value
`TriggerEvaluate` will return `false`.

@note If you want to return false for a condition-function that returns
string (for whatever reason) return `null` instead of `""`

@note *All* functions added via `TriggerAddCondition` are run.
There is no short-circuting. If you want short-circuting use `And` or `Or`.

@note All functions added via `TriggerAddCondition` are run in the order they
were added.
